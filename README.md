# PhD Thesis: Multi agent deep reinforcement learning in mobile robotics

This is the repositeriy for my PhD Thesis about "Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning in mobile robotics".

The repo will contain (in the corresponding sub-directories) the bibliography, my presentations, my publications, some code and all the documents for my personal wiki (/docs/).

## Wiki
For keeping notes on my research, I created a personal wiki, using Tiddlywiki. It contains pages about different concepts, papers, models, and other interesting things related to my research. 

Anyone can see my wiki using [this link](https://maxtoq.github.io/PhD-Thesis-Multi-agent-deep-reinforcement-learning-in-mobile-robotics/)
